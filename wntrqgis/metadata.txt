description=A QGIS Plugin for the WNTR (EPANET) piped water network modelling package. For creating water network models and visualisation of simulation results within QGIS.
about=<p>A plugin for doing all aspects of piped water networks analysis directly within QGIS. This includes the creation of the model, the simulation and the visualisation of results.</p><p>It is compatible with and import/exports to, EPANET. It uses the EPANET solver by default.</p><p>Compared to other QGIS water network modelling plugins, this plugin aims to be:</p><ul><li>Easy to use. Accessible for those who know how to use QGIS. Well documented, good defaults, clear functionality.</li><li>Integrate the power of QGIS and WNTR. It aims to completement rather than replace features already within QGIS. Data can be manipulated with the standard QGIS tools, processing algorithms, and plugins.</li><li>Robust. Limited, well tested features.</li><li>lexible. Not choosy about how you do things.</li><li>Automatable / programmable. Tools can be used in the QGIS 'model builder' or from  PyQGIS</li></ul><p>If not already installed, the plugin will automatically downloand WNTR from PyPi and unpack it into the plugin's install directory. For a complete install and usage guide see the homepage link.</p>
