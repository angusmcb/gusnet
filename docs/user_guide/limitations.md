# Limitations

The plugin is currently marked as experimental. Some features which exist in WNTR / EPANET  are not yet implemented:
* Water quality analysis
* Controls
* Multiple demands per node.
* Patterns on valves

In addition, Shapefile support is limited (due to a limitation of attribute length to 254 characters)
