# Model Editing

The layers are normal QGIS layers and can be edited / modified / processed / styled / automated in the same ways as any other QGIS layer. In particular:

Digitize from any of the enormous range of data that QGIS can handle.

Snapping tools can be used when drawing the network to make sure that nodes and links connect. Note that this is optional, as the plugin will ‘snap’ the layers when running the model.

Pipe lengths can be calculated automatically.

Elevations can be added to nodes from other sources using either expressions or processing tools..

External data sources or any other layers can be used as background maps or data sources.
