# Model Editing

Gusnet model layers are standard QGIS layers and can be edited, modified, processed, styled, or automated just like any other QGIS layer. In particular:

- **[Digitize](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#digitizing-basics)** features from any of the wide range of data sources that QGIS supports.
- **[Snapping tools](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#snapping)** can be used when drawing the network to ensure nodes and links connect. (This is optional, as the plugin will automatically snap layers when running the model.)
- **[Elevations can be added to nodes](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgisaddgeometryattributes)** from other sources using expressions or processing tools.
- **[External data sources or any other layers can be used as background maps](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/index.html)** or data sources.

These capabilities allow you to take full advantage of QGIS's powerful editing and data management tools when working with your models.
